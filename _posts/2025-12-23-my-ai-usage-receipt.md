title: "My 2025 AI Usage Receipt: 14.3 Billion Tokens Later"

I analyzed my AI coding assistant usage from the past few months and turned it into a CVS-style receipt. The numbers surprised even me.

**[View the full receipt →](/docs/ai-receipt-2025.html)**

## The Big Numbers

Over ~90 days across three different AI coding tools:

- **2,134 sessions**
- **115,968+ messages**  
- **~14.3 billion tokens processed**
- **$6,754 in API costs** (if I'd paid per-token)

That last number is the kicker. I paid around $1,200 in subscriptions. Saved $5,554—an 82% discount.

## The Breakdown

### Claude Code (41 days)

My primary tool. 960 sessions, 106,653 messages. Four different Claude models:

| Model | API Cost |
|-------|----------|
| Claude Opus 4.5 | $2,823 |
| Claude Sonnet 4.5 | $1,977 |
| Claude Opus 4.1 | $467 |
| Claude Haiku 4.5 | $37 |

The ~95% cache hit rate kept costs down significantly. Without caching, this would've been astronomical.

### Codex CLI (90 days)

934 sessions across GPT-5 variants. Lower volume but consistent use as a secondary coding partner.

### Pi Agent (5 days)

The new kid. 240 sessions, 9,315 messages. Multi-model by design—routing between Claude, GPT, Gemini, GLM, and DeepSeek based on task needs.

## Fun Facts

Some stats that made me laugh (and maybe reconsider my life choices):

- **~28.6 million words generated** — that's roughly 114 novels worth of text
- **2,600+ messages per day** on average with Claude Code
- **68 midnight coding sessions** — insomnia or dedication? Yes.
- **9,250 messages on Nov 19** — my busiest day. I don't remember what I was building but it must've been important (or I went down a rabbit hole)
- **1,324 messages** in my longest single session

## Why This Matters

Two observations:

**Subscriptions are a steal.** If you're a power user, the math isn't even close. $200/month for Claude Max vs. $2,650/month in API costs (extrapolated). The value proposition only improves the more you use it.

**This is genuinely new.** A year ago, having 100k+ AI-assisted coding conversations in under three months wasn't possible. The tools didn't exist. Now they do, and they're good enough to use as a primary development methodology.

I'm not showing this off to brag about usage. I'm showing it because these numbers represent a fundamental shift in how software gets written. 

The receipt format is a joke, but the data isn't.

*Receipt generated by Claude, naturally. The irony of using AI to analyze AI usage is not lost on me.*
