Welcome to my blog! This is where I'll share my ideas about Claude Code, development strategies, and research findings.

I've been working on various experiments with development parallelization and Claude Code plugins, and I'm excited to document my learnings here.

Stay tuned for posts about:
- Claude Code strategies and plugins
- Development parallelization techniques
- Research findings and experiments
- Tools and methodologies I've been exploring

Let's build something interesting together.
